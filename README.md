# chatbot_shortanswer
A script that effectively handles user queries with a web interface through Flask and a pre-trained BERT model for question answering. The system extracts keywords from the user request, like 'aspirin' or 'ibuprofen', by string matching and maps them to a detailed context kept in a dictionary. It feeds this context into the BERT model and retrieves the most relevant extract to the query. Measures including execution time and latency are logged for effectiveness monitoring and evaluation of the system.
